# Liquid Glass Working Phase Docs

These files break the main redesign plan into smaller implementation chunks.

- Primary reference: `docs/LIQUID-GLASS-REDESIGN.md`
- Working files in this directory are intentionally mutable during implementation.
- Checkpoint registry: `docs/liquid-glass-phases/CHECKPOINTS.md`
- Deferred UX polish tracker: `docs/liquid-glass-phases/polish-backlog.md`
- Post-phase working TODO: `docs/liquid-glass-phases/todo-post-phase-06-polish.md`
