# Liquid Glass Working Phase Docs

These files break the main redesign plan into smaller implementation chunks.

- Primary reference: `docs/LIQUID-GLASS-REDESIGN.md`
- Working files in this directory are intentionally mutable during implementation.

## Phase Order

1. `docs/liquid-glass-phases/phase-00-cleanup-build-safety.md`
2. `docs/liquid-glass-phases/phase-01-foundations-tokens.md`
3. `docs/liquid-glass-phases/phase-02-layout-shell.md`
4. `docs/liquid-glass-phases/phase-025-native-motion.md`
5. `docs/liquid-glass-phases/phase-03-feed-video.md`
6. `docs/liquid-glass-phases/phase-04-subscriptions-channel-onboarding.md`
7. `docs/liquid-glass-phases/phase-05-settings-supporting-pages.md`
8. `docs/liquid-glass-phases/phase-06-hardening.md`

## Usage

For each phase file:

- Track implementation tasks as checked/unchecked items.
- Update decisions and deviations in the Notes section.
- Keep acceptance criteria current with what was actually shipped.
- Add links to relevant PRs/commits.
